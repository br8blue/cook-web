<h1>What is Paella?</h1>
<h4>Paella is an extremely well known rice dish that originated in Valencia, a region in Spain. It's also considered symbolic
    of Valencian and Spanish culture. It consists of rice, meat, and vegetables. The meats involved include chicken and rabbit.
    Also, some times sea food is added as well. As for vegetables, green beans and lima beans are added.

<h1>Origin</h1>
<h4> In the 900s, people in Al-Andalus starting farming rice very frequently. Due to this mass production
    of rice, locals near the Iberian Peninsula starting preparing and eating lots of rice, fish, and spices 
    for both family and religious gatherings. Due to how significant and regular this become to people back then,
    by the 1400s, rice became an iconic staple of Spanish agriculture and cuisine. As for it's name, it means 
    "frying pan" in Valencian due to the fact that it was commonly cooked in a hollow frying pan.

<h1>Etiquette</h1>
<h4>Unlike a lot of other foods, paella has relatively simple etiquette that must be respected when eating.
    For starters, on the bottom layer of the casserole, there is something called "socarrat". The socarrat is considered
    the best part, and is therefore conserved and equally served to everyone at the dinner table. Also, you can eat
    paella with any utensil, but it's traditionally consumed with a spoon, usually wooden. However, there is 
    one rule that isn't very simple or obvious to some people. The rule about the pan. 
    In Valencia, paella is eaten <i>directly</i> from the serving pan or casserole, so there is no need 
    for plates.
