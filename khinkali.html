<h1>What is Khinkali?</h1>
<h4>Khinkali is a popular traditional dish in the country of <i>Georgia</i>, not to be confused
with the state in the US. It is similar to a dumpling, as it is made of twisted dough.
It is also stuffed with cottage cheese, meat, and some vegetables. The most commonly used meats for it include
beef and pork, and people also put in mashed potato and mushrooms.  </h4>

<h1>Origin</h1>
<h4>We've already established it's a traditional dish in Georgia (the nation). This may lead you to believe
    the food was actually created there, but that would be false! The earliest version of khinkali stems from the 13th
    century. Back then, the largest empire in the world was the Mongol Empire, which covered most of Asia
    and even some of Europe! Because of this, the Mongolians probably carried the idea of dumplings from 
    China, and therefore took it with them all the way to Georgia, where the locals there learned what is was.
    The reason they took it to Georgia, was because it just so happened to be along the <i>Silk Road</i>, one of the most important 
    routes of trade back then. It was also because Mongolian conquerers would stuff their meat in dough, this way the 
    meat would be conserved better while horse-riding.

<h1>Etiquette</h1>
<h4>Not all foods are meant to be consumed the same, so what about khinkali? Like most food, khinkali has 
    rules that apply to it when eating in a respectful manner. When the meat is stuffed into the dumpling, it is 
    put in raw. That way, since the meat's already inside, the khinkali and all the ingredients will be cooked with it,
    and the juices will be trapped within the dough. To make your khinkali juicier, many people add warm water or even broth
    to the meat. Also, you should <i>never</i> use a fork for eating khinkali. Using a fork will pierce into
    the dumpling and cause all the juices to spill out. You may also notice that at the top of the khinkali, there 
    are knots. These knots are not meant to be eaten.
