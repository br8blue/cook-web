<h1>What is Biriyani?</h1>
<h4>Biriyani is a very popular food in many countries of South Asia. Some of these countries include India,
    Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, etc. It is made with rice, meat, some vegetables, and most importantly,
    spice! It can be eaten both as a vegetarian <i>and</i> non-vegetarian dish. For the most part, the meat
    people use for biriyani include chicken, goat, lamb, etc. Also, sometimes people add eggs or potatoes,
    in the event that the person who is eating the meal is vegetarian.

<h1>Origin</h1>
<h4> The origins of Biriyani are actually quite a mystery! No one knows for sure, but some theories
    <i>have</i> circulated. However, the one that makes the most sense is the theory that it originated from Persia.
    The word "biriyani" is actually derived from a Persian word, that word being "birian". Because of this, 
    one can infer that biriyani and Persian culture and cuisine must have strong ties. Plus, among foods in 
    Persian cuisine, there are also other rice dishes like "pulao", and "pilaf" that were very popular. Another 
    similar theory is that biriyani came from chefs of the Mughal Empire, which was an Indian empire. The theory
    states that perhaps the people who first prepared biriyani took inspiration from Persian culture and blended
    it was some Indian spices and other ingredients.

<h1>Etiquette</h1>
<h4>In several cultures, biriyani is eaten with your right hand. Despite this though, many people around the 
    world do eat it with utensiles, like forks and spoons. If you have biriyani and it is <i>too</i> spicy for you,
    you can always eat it with a side of raita! Raita is a dish that consists of a mixture of yogurt, vegetables and some herbs.
    The vegetables that are most commonly used include onions, cucumbers, and sometimes tomatoes. So, if the 
    biriyani is too spicy for you, just eat some raita on the side!
